# Sellora– Trust-First Local Commerce Platform

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern e-commerce platforms focus on speed and scale but fail in:
- Trust (fake reviews, unknown sellers)
- Transparency (returns, refurbished items, quality mismatch)
- Local economy support
- Honest resale of return / second-hand products

Customers face:
- Low-quality products
- High return frustration
- No clarity between new, returned, refurbished, or used items

Local sellers and small businesses face:
- No visibility
- High platform fees
- Inability to compete with large brands

---

## 2. Core Idea

Sellora is a **trust-first commerce platform** that combines:

1. **Verified Local Sellers**
2. **Certified Return & Second-Life Products**
3. **Transparent Trust Scores instead of fake reviews**

The platform focuses on **confidence, not convenience addiction**.

## 3. Key Differentiator (Why TRUSTAAR is Different)

Unlike Amazon, Flipkart, Blinkit, or Zepto:
- Sellora does NOT optimize for fastest delivery
- Sellora optimizes for **lowest regret**

No infinite scrolling.  
No fake discounts.  
No unknown sellers.

## 4. Core Modules

### 4.1 Local Verified Sellers Marketplace
